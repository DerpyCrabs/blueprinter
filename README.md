# Blueprinter

This library allows you to define different ways of presenting your data depending on context.

You can make a blueprint for your object and select which fields to keep and define how to get other fields (sync or async).
Blueprints are composable so you can reuse your definitions for different contexts.

Example usage is shown in tests.

Based on the ideas of the [blueprinter](https://github.com/procore/blueprinter) for ruby but simpler and fully typed.
